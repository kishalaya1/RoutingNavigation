# RoutingNavigation :
This is sample appicaton providing rudimentary example of routing between areas and controllers.
The exmple is a very simple one of having a login page and then based on user or admin reroute to aarticular area of user or admin.
The project s in asp.net Core 7.
Please note for keeping the example simple I haven't passed user data between areas.However there are hooks present
in the controllers for you to add code to pass the data.
